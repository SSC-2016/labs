# lab 6. 2-3 November - Attacks on TCP/IP Protocols

This week we will start working on a new class of security vulnerabilities, those at a network level.

## Required Reading
- [SEED lab materials on Attacks on TCP/IP Protocols](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Attacks_TCPIP/)
	- please make sure you get a look at the tools used, there is a link to the [netwox/netwag troubleshooting guide](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Misc/netwox.pdf)  
- [the class materials on network security](http://staff.cs.upt.ro/~marius/curs/sec/index.html)

## Additional Information 
This lab requires interaction, over the network, of at least 3 machines. There is [a guide](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu11_04_VM/VirtualBox_MultipleVMs.pdf) if you need to make your VM visible from the outside.

## Tuesday and Wednesday 08-10
- students can work alone or in groups of 2 to 3 students

In this lab you will get familiar with:
- networking tools
- tcp protocol
- network vulnerabilities

### Lab Report

Select one of the tasks from 1 to 7 and submit a lab report. 

The report should cover the following sections:

- Design: The design of your attacks, including the attacking strategies, the packets that you use in your attacks, the tools that you used, etc.

- Observation: Is your attack successful? How do you know whether it has succeeded or not? What do you expect to see? What have you observed? Is the observation a surprise to you?

- Explanation: Some of the attacks might fail. If so, you need to find out what makes them fail. You can find the explanations from your own experiments (preferred) or from the Internet. If you get the explanation from the Internet, you still need to find ways to verify those explanations through your own experiments. You need to convince us that the explanations you get from the Internet can indeed explain your observations.

## Reminder - Security Talk (presentation)
- this is the final week for choosing a topic
- in week 6 topic list should already be final 

### Quizz

Please remember there will be a quizz at the start of this lab. Therefore, try to understand the core concepts.

On Tuesday and Wednesday morning, the quiz will be given in the first 10 minutes of the lab. 
Please make sure to make it on time. 

### Installing the Virtual Machine

You can even learn by practicing at home. In order to do that, [follow the instructions on how to set up your environment, and download the correct VM](https://github.com/SSC-2016/lab-rules/blob/master/README.md#general-workflow).

Bring a USB stick with the VM as a backup to the lab.
