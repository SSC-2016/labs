# lab 2. 04-05 October

This week we will be trying to gain understanding of the Set-UID security mechanism in \*nix OSes. Please focus on understanding how to write Set-UID programs, and the principle way of attacking them. From here on out, we will be following the guides, and materials made available by the SEED labs.

### Installing the Virtual Machine

You can even learn by practicing at home. In order to do that, [follow the instructions on how to set up your environment, and download the correct VM](https://github.com/SSC-2016/lab-rules/blob/master/README.md#general-workflow).
