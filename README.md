# lab 6. 2-3 November - Attacks on TCP/IP Protocols

This week we will start working on a new class of security vulnerabilities, those at a network level.

## Required Reading
- [SEED lab materials on Attacks on TCP/IP Protocols](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Attacks_TCPIP/)
	- please make sure you get a look at the tools used, there is a link to the [netwox/netwag troubleshooting guide](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Misc/netwox.pdf)  
- [the class materials from weeks 5](http://staff.cs.upt.ro/~marius/curs/sec/2015/index.html)

## Additional Information 
This lab requires interaction, over the network, of at least 3 machines. I will be providing a configuration script to set up a such a three virtual machine setup asap.

## Reminder - Security Talk (presentation)
- this is the final week for choosing a topic
- in week 6 topic list should already be final 

### Quizz

Please remember there will be a quizz at the start of this lab. Therefore, try to understand the core concepts.

On Tuesday and Wednesday morning, the quiz will be given in the first 10 minutes of the lab. 
Please make sure to make it on time. 

### Installing the Virtual Machine

You can even learn by practicing at home. In order to do that, [follow the instructions on how to set up your environment, and download the correct VM](https://github.com/SSC-2016/lab-rules/blob/master/README.md#general-workflow).

Bring a USB stick with the VM as a backup to the lab.
