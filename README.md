- [SEED lab materials on XSS Attacks](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Web/XSS_Collabtive/)
- [SEED lab materials on SQL-injection Attacks](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Web/SQL_Injection_Collabtive/)
- [the class materials on network security](http://staff.cs.upt.ro/~marius/curs/sec/index.html)

## Additional Information
- [Play arround with an insecure web application](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Webgoat#tab=Main)
	- for other insecure applications check the following [link](https://www.checkmarx.com/2015/04/16/15-vulnerable-sites-to-legally-practice-your-hacking-skills/)
- useful tools for penetration testing 
	- [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)] (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project)
	

## Tuesday and Wednesday 08-10
- students can work alone or in groups of 2 to 3 students
- select one of the attacks and demonstrate it
- you can use either the SEED materials or one of the vulnerable web applications

### Lab Report

Students need to submit a detailed lab report to describe what they have done and what they have observed.

Report should include the evidences to support the observations. Evidences include packet traces, screendumps, etc.

## Important!!! Final grades - draft
- total number of labs is 8
- students can have maximum 2 absences out of 8 labs

### Quizz

Please remember there will be a quizz at the start of this lab. Therefore, try to understand the core concepts.

On Tuesday and Wednesday morning, the quiz will be given in the first 10 minutes of the lab. 
Please make sure to make it on time. 

### Installing the Virtual Machine

You can even learn by practicing at home. In order to do that, [follow the instructions on how to set up your environment, and download the correct VM](https://github.com/SSC-2016/lab-rules/blob/master/README.md#general-workflow).

Bring a USB stick with the VM as a backup to the lab.
