# lab 7. 09-10 November - DNS Attacks 

The objective of this lab is to understand how DNS attacks work. 
Students will first set up and configure a DNS server, and then they will try various DNS Pharming attacks on the target that is also within the lab environment.

## Required Reading
- [SEED lab materials on DNS Attacks](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Attacks_DNS/)
- [SEED lab materials on Attacks on TCP/IP Protocols](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs/Attacks_TCPIP/)
	- please make sure you get a look at the tools used, there is a link to the [netwox/netwag troubleshooting guide](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Misc/netwox.pdf)  
- [the class materials on network security](http://staff.cs.upt.ro/~marius/curs/sec/index.html)

## Additional Information
- [netwox examples](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/cis758/netw522/netwox-doc_html/html/examples.html)
- This lab requires interaction, over the network, of at least 3 machines. There is [a guide](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Documentation/Ubuntu11_04_VM/VirtualBox_MultipleVMs.pdf) if you need to make your VM visible from the outside.

## Tuesday and Wednesday 08-10
- students can work alone or in groups of 2 to 3 students

In this lab you will get familiar with:
- DNS configuration
- networking tools
- tcp protocol
- network vulnerabilities

### Lab Report

Students need to submit a detailed lab report to describe what they have done and what they have observed.

Report should include the evidences to support the observations. Evidences include packet traces, screendumps, etc.


### Quizz

Please remember there will be a quizz at the start of this lab. Therefore, try to understand the core concepts.

On Tuesday and Wednesday morning, the quiz will be given in the first 10 minutes of the lab. 
Please make sure to make it on time. 

### Installing the Virtual Machine

You can even learn by practicing at home. In order to do that, [follow the instructions on how to set up your environment, and download the correct VM](https://github.com/SSC-2016/lab-rules/blob/master/README.md#general-workflow).

Bring a USB stick with the VM as a backup to the lab.
